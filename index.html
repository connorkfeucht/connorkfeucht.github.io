        Hello! I'm a Computer Science Graphics student studying at University of Victoria, and <br>
        I am currently in my third year of studies!
    </p>
    <p>
        If I'm not studying or working, you can usually find me cooking my defenders on the basketball court, hanging <br>
        out with my friends, thrifting, or playing video games!
    </p>
    <p>I've also worked on a number of technical projects, if you'd like to take a look at those, click <a href="projects.html">Here.</a></p>
