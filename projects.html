    <h2>Robo Rampage</h2>
    <h3>Summer 2023</h3>
    <p>
        Robo Rampage is a game that I developed in the summer of 2023 after my first year of university, using Unity <br>
        and C#. It was the first game that I took the time to try and develop by myself, and it was a great learning experience. <br>
        I had a lot of fun working on this project and I definitely want to make another game soon.

    <h2>NoteNudge</h2>
    <h3>December 2023 - Present</h3>
    <p>
        NoteNudge.com is a website which helps students study by turning their lecture notes and videos into flash cards! <br>
        It is a really fun and interesting project started by my friend Dylan, and they are getting me to do some front end <br>
        work for them.
